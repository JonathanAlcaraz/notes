# Lecture Notes

I started this project at the beginning of Summer (2017) in hopes of digitally archiving my lecture notes from my first year of grad school here at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). This project is taking longer than I thought, especially since a lot of my time this summer is being spent studying for qualifying exams which I will be taking at the beginning of Fall before the new quarter starts. I probably won't be done by then, but I'll keep working on this throughout the summer and into the new quarter. Also, with the new quarter, I hope to add the lecture notes from the courses I'm taking as I'm taking them.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding something in these notes, contact me via my school email (`jalcaraz@math.ucr.edu`) and include something about Lecture Notes in the subject line.
